This is a SabancÄ± University graduation project, in cooperation with General Electric. The title of the project is "Estimation of Cycle Time in Transformer Manufacturing Using a Vision Based Learning Technique". The aim of the project is to implement human detection and feature matching algorithms, which can work concurrently. 

The program starts with a very simple GUI, which can be seen below:

On the current version of the algorithm, the human detection algorithm is able to detect the person within the frame in real time, and display:
- Percentage of frames including at least one person
- Time passed after the execution
- Total time having at least one preson within the frame
- How many frames are processed each second
- Average confidence of human detection

Here is an example interface of the human detection algorithm:
