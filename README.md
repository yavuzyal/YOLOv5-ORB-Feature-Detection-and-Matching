#YOLOv5-ORB: Feature Detection & Matching

This is a SabancÄ± University graduation project, in cooperation with General Electric. The title of the project is "Estimation of Cycle Time in Transformer Manufacturing Using a Vision Based Learning Technique". The aim of the project is to implement human detection and feature matching algorithms, which can work concurrently. 

On the current version of the algorithm, the human detection algorithm (YOLOv5) is able to detect the person within the frame in real time, and display:
- Percentage of frames including at least one person
- Time passed after the execution
- Total time having at least one preson within the frame
- How many frames are processed each second
- Average confidence of human detection

Here is an example interface of the human detection algorithm:

On the feature matching algorithm (ORB), program is currently able to work in real time and able to do:
- Extract features for each frame
- Match the current frame with a given reference image
- Select best match of the current frame among a dataset of reference images



The program starts with a very simple GUI, which can be seen below:
